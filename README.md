# HIDS
Host-based Intrusion Detection System
<br>
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) using OSQuery on Kali Linux. It includes automated query scheduling for real-time monitoring and logging of system activities to detect suspicious behavior. Logs and configurations are optimized to track file integrity, monitor processes, and audit network activity, providing foundational insight into HIDS operations. This project exemplifies the use of open-source tools in a practical cybersecurity scenario, with configurations designed for efficiency and ease of deployment.
